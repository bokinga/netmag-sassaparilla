How this is set-up
===================
===================

We've set-up this tutorial accompaniment in a really minimal way, so you can experiment with the grid.
See [Sassaparilla's documentation](https://github.com/fffunction/sassaparilla/blob/master/README.md) on how to set up the project.
Note, to get sass compiling you'd need to CD (change directory) into the Compass folder before telling Compass to watch
